School ERP is a free erp and Crm for schools and academies. 
After 11 years directing schools, I want to create the tool that is really useful for what I know schools need.

### Tech

School ERP done with JavaScript REACT, with MUI framework and some ANT excerpts.
The main design is from [MANTIS](https://mantisdashboard.io)
